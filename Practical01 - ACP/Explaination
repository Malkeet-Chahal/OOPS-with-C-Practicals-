Hello...
I have created a code using C++ language of "Hello World"...
In this I have shown different files such as preprocessor file, compiler file, assembler file...
For Preprocessor file - g++ -E hw.cpp >> xyz.i
For Compiler - g++ -S hw.cpp (this file is saved with .s extension)...
For Assembler - g++ -c hw.cpp
For Linker - g++ -O hw.cpp
