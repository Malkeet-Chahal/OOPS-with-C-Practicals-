In task 1:
  We have used " #include<iostream.h> " library.By using this,we faced an fatal error while running the code in preprocessor unit....
 In task 2:
  We haven't used " #include<iostream> ".By this we observed that code is running properly in preprocessor unit....
  
 Conclusion of task1 and task2:
  We concluded that preprocessor unit check whether given library in the code is correct or not....
  
  
  
In Task 3:
  We write a code for taking char as input but we actually give int as input and we get to know that it is printing only first number of given input....
  
In Task 4:
  We tried to solve the problem in task3.By using get() function it only prints first value so to overcome this we used getline() function so that it reads 
  entire string and give the string as output....
